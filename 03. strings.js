//Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

// \'	single quote
// \"	double quote
// \\	backslash
// \n	newline
// \r	carriage return
// \t	tab
// \b	word boundary
// \f	form feed

// This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. using the += operator. Use the += operator similar

// then add on the second string.

// Setup

//Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.

//Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.
// Setup
const lastName3 = "Lovelace";
